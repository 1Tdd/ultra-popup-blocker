## üåü What Makes This the *Enhanced* Edition?

This script began with the solid foundation of [Eskander's original Ultra Popup Blocker](https://github.com/Eskander/ultra-popup-blocker). This new version, completely re-architected by **1Tdd**, elevates it with powerful new features and a modern architecture to meet the challenges of today's web.

Here‚Äôs a comparison of the key enhancements:

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Intelligent 3-State Logic
You are always in control. For every website, you can choose to:
-   üîµ **Allow:** Let all popups through. Perfect for sites you trust.
-   üî¥ **Deny:** Silently block all popups without any notification. Ideal for websites you never want to be interrupted by again.
-   ‚ùî **Ask (Default):** The script blocks the popup and presents a beautiful, non-intrusive notification bar, asking you what to do.

### Advanced Blocking Engine
-   **Window Popups:** Intercepts `window.open` calls, distinguishing between user-initiated actions and aggressive scripts.
-   **Tab Opening Links:** Blocks links and forms designed to open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).
-   **Modal & Overlay Blocking:** Detects and hides annoying elements that cover the page, like newsletter signups and cookie banners, while automatically re-enabling page scrolling.
-   **Redirect Protection:** A powerful shield activates when a popup is blocked, preventing the original page from being redirected to an unwanted site.

### Modern & User-Friendly
-   **Sleek "Glass" UI:** A beautiful, dark-mode, glassmorphism interface for all notifications and configuration panels.
-   **Custom Logo & Icons:** A polished and professional look and feel.
-   **Escape Hatch:** If our modal blocker ever gets in the way of a legitimate login window, use the "Disable Modal Blocker (1 Tab)" command from your userscript manager's menu to temporarily pause it.

## üîß How to Use

*   **The Notification Bar:** When a popup is blocked, a sleek bar will appear at the bottom of the screen with clear options.
*   **Configuration Panel:** Access the configuration panel from the "‚öôÔ∏è Config" button on the notification bar, or through the Tampermonkey menu. Here you can manually add, view, and remove sites from your Allowed and Denied lists.
*   **Toast Notifications:** When on a "Denied" site or when a modal is hidden, you'll receive a discreet, temporary notification in the bottom-right corner.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Credits & Thanks

*   **1Tdd** - Lead developer of the Enhanced Edition.
*   **Eskander** - For creating the original, foundational Ultra Popup Blocker.
