This is an enhanced and actively maintained fork of the original **[Ultra Popup Blocker](https://github.com/Eskander/ultra-popup-blocker)** by Eskander.

This version goes beyond the original by introducing a powerful **blacklist feature ("Always Deny")** and a more advanced detection engine that can block a wider variety of popups, including those triggered by clicks.

## Core Features

*   üö´ **Whitelist & Blacklist Support**: You have full control. You can permanently allow popups from trusted sites or permanently deny them from annoying ones.
*   üí° **Advanced Popup Detection**: Blocks popups generated by both JavaScript (`window.open`) and user clicks on links (`target="_blank"`), making it much more effective.
*   üîî **Configurable Notification Bar**: When a popup is blocked, a discreet bar appears, giving you the choice to allow it once, always allow it (whitelist), or always deny it (blacklist).
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy Management Panel**: Manage your whitelisted and blacklisted sites directly from the Tampermonkey menu, without needing the notification bar.

## How It Works

When a website tries to open a popup, this script intercepts the attempt and prevents it. Instead of the popup, you will see a small notification bar at the bottom of the page.

From this bar, you have several choices:
*   **üü¢ Allow Once**: Allows this specific popup to open one time.
*   **üîµ Always Allow**: Adds the website to your **whitelist**. All future popups from this site will be allowed automatically.
*   **üö´ Always Deny**: Adds the website to your **blacklist**. All future popups from this site will be blocked silently, with no notification.
*   **üî¥ Deny**: Denies this specific popup and closes the bar.

## Usage

### Blocking a Popup
The script works automatically. Just browse the web, and it will block popups as they appear.

### Managing Your Lists
You don't need to wait for a popup to manage your permissions.
1.  Click the **Tampermonkey icon** in your browser's toolbar.
2.  From the dropdown menu, click **"Ultra Popup Blocker: Manage Permissions"**.
3.  A panel will appear, showing your whitelisted and blacklisted sites. You can remove any site by clicking the `√ó` icon next to it.

### Management Panel
You can easily manage your whitelisted and blacklisted sites at any time.
